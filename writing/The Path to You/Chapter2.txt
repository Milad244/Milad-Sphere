The pitch-black void stretches infinitely in every direction, swallowing all light and sound. My soul melds with my former self, and for a fleeting moment, a glimmer of hope sprouts within me. Yet reality quickly settles in, and the freezing vacuum of the abyss descends upon me, shattering every nerve in my body. The sensation is alien and overwhelming, a harsh reminder that I am trapped in a physical form once more. A perpetual cycle of suffering that feels insurmountable, “hell!” I cry out in agony.
A faint chuckle echoes from above. The chuckle grows, unraveling into full-blown, uncontrollable laughter. But the laughter soon devolves into violent coughing - harsh, painful spasms that sound more tragic than amusing.
I glance upward to find a blackened, grotesque soul hovering above me. How this wretched thing can even speak is beyond me - and I don’t care to figure it out.
The soul clears its throat with an exaggerated rasp. “This ain’t hell, just the buffer zone, because for hell to maintain-”
“I don’t care!” I cut him off, my voice stern. “I just need to return to her!”
A long silence follows, thick and ominous. Then his voice slithers through the darkness, sharp and venomous.
“You disgusting, filthy, insolent pig.” His words hiss with contempt. “How dare you interrupt me for something so pathetically stupid.”
The malice in his voice lingers for a moment before he shifts, adopting a disturbingly casual tone, as though none of it really mattered.
“You will never leave this place but that goes without saying.”
He pauses, as if for effect, “One last thing...”
Suddenly, his voice erupts, brimming with malicious glee. “Welcome to hell!”
A searing wave of heat enters my body, so fierce I feel like I am plunging straight into the heart of the sun. Like the abyss, my body does not deteriorate. Instead, all that I am left with is pain.
Although my face feels like it is about to fall off, I persevere through the heat until I violently crash onto the ground. My face eats the ash off the searing surface but at least I seem to be finally rid of that miserable being.
I leap to my feet and scan my surroundings. But as I look around, all I see is a murky red fog billowing from the raging air. Hours tick by as I continue to search for something - anything. Finally, through the haze, I spot a silhouette just beyond a massive lake of lava.
I grin, despite the pain gnawing at me. “I already got hit by a truck,” I mutter. “Compared to that, this can’t be that bad, right?”
DOTTEDLINE
I awake to the familiar scent of our home. From our bed, I glance around the cozy studio apartment. Everything seems just how it should be: the kitchen equipment neatly arranged, the floor freshly vacuumed, and even our bamboo mattress still feels the same - firm yet soft. I'm usually the one who keeps everything organized, while he has a talent for finding the perfect pieces that turn our apartment into a home. Together, we’re a flawless duo. But something is unmistakably missing. Where is he?
I hazily recount the nightmare, the only lingering memory being the overwhelming dread of separation. A part of me clings desperately to the hope that it was all a lie, that it never really happened. But deep down, I know the truth. The world around me is undeniably wrong.
The subtlety of the wind brushing against my hair is akin to the sensation at an altitude far lower than where our apartment sits. Worse, based on the Sun’s movement and our location, there’s no possible way it shouldn’t be facing us. Yet, it is nowhere to be seen.
Most unsettling of all, my Kayn is gone. He has never once left me without at least leaving a note. I don’t know what’s happening, but I must find him, no matter what. If only I could remember. But each time I try to piece together what happened, an icy numbness grows in me, freezing every part of my body.
I get up from our bed, a mere mimicry, and make my way to the exit. My suspicions were right. Instead of exiting into our apartment hallway, I find myself in a strange new world. 
A dazzling light shines down from the translucent blue sky, illuminating the fresh grass that spreads everywhere. Spirit blossom trees surround our apartment, and dandelions crowd the green below. 
If he were here, I would relish this vibrant scene. I’d lay my head on his lap, and as he softly caressed my cheek, we’d marvel at the spirit blossom petals drifting down around us. Instead, the sky feels gray, the grass dull, and honestly, I just wish this world would disappear. Unfortunately, I am trapped, endlessly staring at the bark, seeing nothing more than a hollow reflection of what once mattered to Kayn.
My silent tears begin to soak my pants. “Fuck,” I whisper under my breath, defeat washing over me. I know once they start, they don’t stop. My tears endlessly flow, each one a reminder of everything I’ve lost. As I sink deeper into my despair, time blurs around me, until I eventually perish.
