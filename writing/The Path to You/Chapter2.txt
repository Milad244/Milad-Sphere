The pitch black abyss flickers white while my soul goes back to my previous body. For a brief moment, I feel hope - but it’s crushed almost instantly. Immediately, I feel the freezing vacuum of the abyss shatter every nerve in my body. 
“Is this really hell?” I cry out in pain.
 A faint chuckle echoes from above. The chuckle grows, unraveling into full-blown, uncontrollable laughter. But the laughter soon devolves into violent coughing - harsh, painful spasms that sound more tragic than amusing.
I glance upward to find a blackened, grotesque soul hovering above me. How this wretched thing can even speak is beyond me - and I don’t care to figure it out.
The soul clears its throat with an exaggerated rasp. “This is just the buffer zone, because for hell to maintain-”
“I don’t care!” I cut him off, my voice stern. “I just need to return to her!”
A long silence follows, thick and ominous. Then his voice slithers through the darkness, sharp and venomous.
“You disgusting, filthy, insolent pig.” His words hiss with contempt. “How dare you interrupt me for something so pathetically stupid.”
The malice in his voice lingers for a moment before he shifts, adopting a disturbingly casual tone, as though none of it really mattered.
“You will never leave this place but that goes without saying.”
He pauses, as if for effect, “One last thing...”
Suddenly, his voice erupts, brimming with malicious glee. “Welcome to hell!”
A searing wave of heat enters my body, so fierce I feel like I am plunging straight into the heart of the sun. Like the abyss, my body does not deteriorate. Instead, all that I am left with is pain.
Although my face feels like it is about to fall off, I persevere through the heat until I violently crash onto the ground. My face eats the ash off the burning ground but at least I am finally rid of that miserable being.
I jump up to my feet and scan my surroundings. But as I look around, all I can see is a murky red fog erupting from the raging ground. A few minutes pass by as I continue to search for something - anything. Finally, through the haze, I spot a silhouette just beyond a massive lake of lava.
I grin, despite the pain gnawing at me. “I already got hit by a truck,” I mutter. “Compared to that, this can’t be that bad, right?”
DOTTEDLINE
	I awake to the familiar scent of our home. From our bed, I glance around the cozy studio apartment. Everything seems just how it was. The kitchen equipment neatly arranged, the floor freshly vacuumed, and even our bamboo mattress still feels the same: firm yet soft. I take care of the organizing, and he always buys the best products. A flawless duo. But where is my Kayn? 
	I hazily recount the nightmare, the only lingering memory being the overwhelming dread of separation. My head grows heavy, and though I try to calm myself, it’s no use. A part of me clings desperately to hope. But deep down, I know something is wrong. The world around me is undeniably wrong.
The subtlety of the wind brushing against my hair is akin to the sensation at an altitude far lower than where our apartment sits. Worse, based on the Sun’s movement and our location, there’s no possible way it shouldn’t be facing us. Yet, it is nowhere to be seen.
Most unsettling of all, my Kayn is gone. He has never once left me without at least leaving a note. I don’t know what’s happening, but I must find him, no matter what. If only I could remember... 
Each time I try to piece together what happened, an icy numbness grows in me, spreading from my chest to every part of my body. It’s not just cold - it’s the same soul-crushing void I felt in the nightmare, the same darkness that stole Kayn from me.
