The night sky is pitch black, with the moon shining down on us as the only light. As she lays lifeless in my arms, I feel the grass brush against my knees, locking them in place. I plead, “Just hold on a little longer.” Even now, she looks at me with such radiance, her breath shallow but steady. Her eyes flutter closed for a moment before opening again, with her dazzling blue gaze locked onto me.

“I’m sorry,” she whispers.

I’ve never seen my Kayn so lost. Even still, the warmth of his arms sinks into me, wrapping around my heart. I wouldn’t mind staying here forever, but the reality is my pulse is slowing. On one hand, I fear for what he’ll become without me. On the other, I’m terrified of the unknown. Will I be able to watch over him? Will I find myself in some distant world, unreachable? Or, worst of all, will I simply cease to be?

I don’t want to burden him with a promise he cannot keep, and I know it’s selfish to ask. Still, the longing takes control of me, uncontainable, despite my efforts to silence it.

As the weight of our impending separation settles over us, we plead in unison, “Please, be with me for the rest of time.”

How could he possibly say the same words? What's more, I see a flicker of hope in his scarlet eyes, a spark that defies the despair closing in around us. His gaze anchors me, just like it always has.

With the last of my strength, I ask, “What is it?”

DOTTEDLINE

She’s fading, slipping through my fingers like sand. I vow, hoping she can hear me, “I’m going to join you.”

Her body softens, and with a faint but genuine smile, her final breath escapes, and her eyes slowly close for the last time.

Gently, I lay her down, my fingers brushing through the soft strands of her long black hair. I linger for only a moment, allowing the sight of her to etch itself into my memory.

DOTTEDLINE

It’s strange - I feel weightless, and though I no longer possess a body, my senses are somehow sharper than ever. And there’s something more that isn’t quite my own. I can feel the chill on his skin, the warmth of his breath, and the unwavering resolve within him, as if his body has become mine. I can see into every corner of his heart. It unfolds before me, revealing a depth of love that is solely and unwaveringly for me.

I make my way toward the road, the breeze stirs the grass sending dust into my eyes, though I barely register it. I spot a truck approaching ahead, I hurry, not wanting to make Leena wait any longer.

I leap from the side of the road straight into the truck’s path. In an instant it’s over. Red splashes across the white steel, and the sound of shattering glass echoes in the stillness. But there’s no pain - only the warmth of her heart, filling me with peace as I prepare to reunite with her.

I can see her soul hovering above her lifeless body. It beckons me, urging me forward with an irresistible pull. Without hesitation, I make my way toward her. The physical world lies beneath me, but I feel as if I am navigating through a dream rather than reality.

But just as I am about to close the distance between us, a dark force grips me, yanking me down into the abyss. With all my power, I try to resist, but the darkness drowns me, wrapping around me in chains and locking me up.

DOTTEDLINE

Panic surges through me as I watch him start to fade. “Kayn!” I shout, desperation clawing at my throat. I reach out, instinctively trying to bridge the distance, but it feels like an impenetrable barrier has risen between us, anchoring me in place. Confusion floods my mind as I struggle against the invisible force holding me back. Why can’t I join him? I would follow him anywhere, just like he did for me. What’s wrong with me?

The space between us is growing, yet I can only stand here, helplessly watching as he slips away into the darkness. As he vanishes, I am left broken beyond repair, haunted by only one thought: I should have been the one to follow him.
