This is the piece of writing that I am working on the most. What you are currently reading is only a draft, and very incomplete since it only contains the first 2 chapters. Every night, instead of sleeping, my brain just decides to brainstorm the story, and whenever I get a good idea I write it in my notes. Although this has made falling asleep a massive pain, I now have a really amazing story and I cannot wait to write it.
