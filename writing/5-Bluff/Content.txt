Players: 2+  
Objective: Get rid of all your cards to stay safe. Avoid losing lives by not getting caught bluffing. The last player with cards loses one life.

Setup:  
1. Use a standard deck (including jokers).  
2. Deal 5 cards to each player. Discard any extras.  
3. Choose the House Color (red or black). Jokers count as the House Color.  
4. Each player starts with 5 lives.  

Gameplay:  
1. Players take turns placing cards face down. The goal is to match the House Color, but bluffing is allowed.  
2. The next player can call a bluff:  
   - If the cards donâ€™t match, the player who placed them loses a life.  
   - If the cards match, the player who called the bluff loses a life.  
3. If a player gets rid of their cards, they are safe and out for the rest of the round.  
4. The round ends when only one player has cards left, and they lose a life.  

Winning:  
The game continues until only one player has lives remaining. That player wins!
