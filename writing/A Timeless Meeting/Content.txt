She leapt into the air. “Another step forward,” she warned, “and you die.” Her long, wavy strawberry-colored hair floated as if held by her very presence. 

As she landed, she let out a giggle. Despite her small stature, and a voice that seemed too light for an immortal, there was no mistaking the threat. I knew that if I so much as turned my head, it would surely be severed from my body.
	
Her piercing purple eyes locked onto mine, daring me to defy her. The oversized black lab coat she wore nearly swallowed her whole, its stark darkness making her pale skin almost luminescent. A mischievous grin spread across her face, as if she relished her undeniable authority.

"How... did... you... get... here?" she asked, dragging out each word, tilting her head dramatically with every syllable. An orange lollipop materialized out of thin air and, as if it had a mind of its own, floated effortlessly into her mouth.

Her patience quickly unraveled. "ANSWER!" she snapped. Then, as though flipping a switch, her tone softened into a pitiful whimper. "Answer," she repeated, her bottom lip trembling in sorrow. The glint in her eyes, however, betrayed her feigned fragility.

Sensing the rapid shifts in her mood and the looming threat of another outburst, I stammered, “Well, I had a few dreams that might’ve included you, and then I just… somehow ended up here?”

She narrowed her gaze, tilting her head as if trying to decipher my answer. For a fleeting moment, her expression shifted, her dangerous demeanor fading. Her violet eyes seemed to look through me, as though I were an illusion. That’s when I took in our surroundings.

This place was unlike anything else, both familiar and alien. It was the same void I’d seen in my dreams: an infinite expanse of nothingness. No stars, no planets, no celestial bodies of any kind. Just an empty, perfect void. I had half-expected her to adorn it with grand icy castles or swirling wormholes, but she’d left it untouched - just as I had always imagined. Perhaps she shared my unspoken understanding of this place. I only hoped she didn’t feel the same way about me.

“Nope,” she finally said, her voice cutting through my thoughts.

She crossed her arms and floated upside down, her hair flowing freely in defiance of gravity. “You simply do not exist,” she declared, her voice fading into a whisper as she vanished.

I spoke softly, as if she might still be listening. “I exist.”

I stared into the void she left behind, the emptiness stretching out before me. Disbelief settled over me like a heavy fog. Each passing second seemed to drag on longer than the last, as I clung to the idea that she couldn’t be gone. She just couldn’t.

“BOO!” 

Her upended face reappeared inches from mine, overflowing with glee.

A sudden jolt raced through me, stopping my heart mid-beat. Instinctively, I masked my relief with a long, disapproving sigh.

“How did you vanish?” I asked, narrowing my eyes. “I thought this was the only place you could exist.”

She pouted, folding her arms. “Oh, so now you know everything, huh?”

“I don’t even know how I got here,” I shot back.

Her grin returned, sly and condescending. “Does your poor little brain need answers?” she cooed, her tone dripping with mockery, like a parent teasing a toddler.

Her majesty didn't wait for a reply. “Fine! Since you’re practically begging on your hands and knees for the truth you so desperately crave, I’ll indulge you.”

She began as if she were about to reveal the secrets of life itself. “I never left, I was just invisible.”

“Maybe a thank you?” she pressed, clearly enjoying herself.

“Well you didn’t mention how we ended up here?” I said plainly.

She continued, “Well it was only natural that after dreaming of this place we-” She paused, her gaze dropping to her feet. “Oh… I don’t actually know,” she admitted.

She floated higher, speaking to herself more than me. “It seems I’ll need to find a different dream now that this one has a new occupant.”

It suddenly struck me that she must have grown accustomed to solitude. Yet, she still seemed untouchable. And still, against every unspoken logic, I found myself wanting to share the space she radiates.

“Do you have the ability to read minds?” I muttered.

“Nope,” she groaned. “Do you?”

“If only,” the longing evident in my tone.

She lazily orbited around me, her hands flowing freely through space. “Just what exactly are you plotting?”

She twirled a full circle, then locked onto me. “Are you planning a backstabbing betrayal?” she playfully teased. 

She stopped abruptly, her gaze narrowing. Before I could react, she dashed sideways, her movement quick and unpredictable. “Or maybe,” she said, “you want to make me your slave?”

Her laughter bubbled out but never reached her eyes. As it faded, her expression grew hollow. Her tone stretched, conflicted, unsure of what it wanted to be. “I guess the truth is you must want me to leave now?”

As those words left her, my body froze. The simple truth was that this world without her was no longer the same world I dreamed of. Yet, I couldn’t say it. Not to her.

A slow breath filled her lungs, calm and almost serene. Around her, a quiet stream of water glided through the air, dancing to a delicate tune. The flow thinned, dwindling into a final drop that lingered briefly before simply ceasing to be.

Her patience had run dry. “Just spit it out,” she irritably requested. “I know what you must think of me.” Her voice thinned, losing its edge. “I won’t snap you in half just for being honest.”

A soft sigh escaped as her body began to go translucent, slowly fading before my eyes.

I couldn’t move. It was as if the air itself had grown too heavy to breathe.

“Wait!” I shouted.

She paused, her half-vanished form in deadlock.

If she goes, I will be left with nothing. For the rest of eternity I would occupy an empty void alone, just as she had. 

"Can we share this world?" I pleaded, my voice a little bolder than I felt.

Her eyes widened in shock, her skin returning whole once more.

“You want me to stay?” she hesitated.

My response came out stiff. “The peace of this world that stretches across a limitless canvas is incomplete without you.”

She slowly lowered to my level, finally sharing my elevation. “You want to spend the rest of eternity with someone like me?” she whispered, a faint blush dusting her cheeks.

I nodded, silently confirming the alien idea.

She quickly hid behind a sly grin, yet beneath the veneer of confidence, her gaze lingered on me, carrying an unexpected softness. “Well then,” she said, her tone firm, commanding, and laced with possessiveness, “welcome to your new life with me.”

Though countless eternities have passed, our first encounter remains as surreal as ever.
