She leapt into the air. “Another step forward,” she warned, “and you die.” Her long, wavy strawberry-colored hair floated as if held by her very presence. 

As she landed, she let out a giggle. Despite her small stature and a voice far too light for an immortal, there was no mistaking the threat. I knew that if I so much as turned my head, it would surely be severed from my body.
	
Her piercing purple eyes locked onto mine, daring me to defy her. The oversized black cloak she wore nearly swallowed her whole, its stark darkness making her pale skin almost luminescent. A mischievous grin spread across her face, as if she relished her undeniable authority.

"How... did... you... get... here?" she asked, tilting her head dramatically with each word. An orange lollipop materialized out of thin air and, as if it had a mind of its own, floated effortlessly into her mouth.

Her patience quickly ran out. "ANSWER!" she snapped. Then, as though flipping a switch, her tone softened into a pitiful whimper. "Answer," she repeated, her bottom lip trembling in sorrow. The glint in her eyes, however, betrayed her feigned fragility.

Sensing the rapid shifts in her mood and the looming threat of another outburst, I stammered, “Well, I had a few dreams that might’ve included you, and then I just… somehow ended up here?”

She narrowed her gaze, tilting her head as if trying to decipher my answer. For a fleeting moment, her expression shifted, her dangerous demeanor fading. Her violet eyes seemed to look through me, as though I were an illusion. That’s when I took in our surroundings.

This place was unlike anything else, both familiar and alien. It was the same void I’d seen in my dreams: an infinite expanse of nothingness. No stars, no planets, no celestial bodies of any kind. Just an empty, perfect void. I had half-expected her to adorn it with grand icy castles or swirling wormholes, but she’d left it untouched.

“Nope,” she finally said, her voice cutting through my thoughts.

She crossed her arms and floated upside down, her hair flowing freely in defiance of gravity. “You simply do not exist,” she declared, her voice fading into a whisper as she vanished.

I didn’t shout. I didn’t plead. I spoke softly, as if she might still be listening, “I exist.”

Silence. 

Disbelief settled over me like a heavy fog. I stood there, clinging to the idea that she couldn’t be gone. She just couldn’t.

“BOO!” 

Her upended face reappeared inches from mine, overflowing with glee.

A jolt surged through me, stopping my heart mid-beat. Instinctively, I masked my relief with a long, disapproving sigh.

“How did you vanish?” I asked, narrowing my eyes. “I assumed this was the only place you could exist.”

She pouted, folding her arms. “Oh, so now you know everything, huh?”

“I don’t even know how I got here,” I shot back.

Her grin returned, sly and condescending. “Does your poor little brain need answers?” she cooed.

Her majesty didn't wait for a reply. “Fine! Since you’re practically begging on your hands and knees for the truth you so desperately crave, I’ll indulge you.”

She straightened, as if preparing to reveal the secrets of the cosmos. “I never left. I was just invisible,” she declared with flourish.

She paused expectantly. “Maybe a thank you?” she added, clearly savoring her performance.

“Well, you didn’t mention how we ended up here?” I said, unimpressed.

She rolled right into her next proclamation. “Well, it was only natural that after dreaming of this place we-” Her words caught. She glanced downward. “Oh… I don’t actually know,” she admitted, her voice low and a touch dejected.

She floated higher, speaking to herself more than me. “It seems I’ll need to find a different dream now that this one has a new occupant.”

It suddenly struck me that she must have grown accustomed to solitude. I wondered how long the void had been her only companion. Still, she seemed untouchable, far beyond my reach.

“Do you have the ability to read minds?” I muttered.

“Nope,” she groaned. “Do you?”

“If only,” the longing evident in my tone.

She lazily orbited around me, her hands flowing freely through space. “Just what exactly are you plotting?”

She twirled a full circle, then locked onto me. “Are you planning a backstabbing betrayal?” she teased playfully.

She stopped abruptly, her gaze narrowing. Before I could react, she dashed sideways, her movement quick and unpredictable. “Or maybe,” she said, “you want to make me your slave?”

Her laughter bubbled out but never reached her eyes. As it faded, her expression grew hollow. Her tone stretched, conflicted, unsure of what it wanted to be. “I guess the truth is you must want me to leave now?”

“Why would you think that?” was what I wanted to say. But I had a feeling, a sense that if I did, those would be my last words.

A slow breath filled her lungs, calm and almost serene. Around her, a quiet stream of water glided through the air, dancing to a delicate tune. The flow thinned, dwindling into a final drop that lingered briefly before simply ceasing to be.

Her patience had run dry. “Just spit it out,” she irritably requested. “I know what you must think of me.” Her voice thinned, losing its edge. “I won’t snap you in half just for being honest.”

A soft sigh escaped as her body began to go translucent, slowly fading before my eyes.

“Wait!” I shouted.

For the first time, shock registered on her face, mirroring my own disbelief at the words that had escaped my lips.

I didn’t have much time. If she left, I would be left with nothing. For the rest of eternity I’d occupy an empty void alone, just as she had.

"Why can’t we share this dream?" I asked, my voice steadier than I felt.

Her skin returned to its full form. She slowly lowered to my level, finally sharing my elevation. “You want to spend the rest of eternity with someone like me?” she whispered, a faint blush dusting her cheeks.

“Well, first, I need some guarantees,” I said, trying to sound authoritative.

With a dismissive tilt of her head, she replied, “Is that so?”

“I am not to be harmed!” I stated, my voice firm.

She gasped, her eyes wide with disbelief, a hand flying to her chest in offense. “You think I would ever harm you?” she asked, full of incredulity.

She held still, like she was waiting for me to take it back. The silence that followed was thick, as I caught a flicker of genuine dismay in her expression. “Okay,” she muttered. “I won’t harm you. Geez.” Her words trailed off as if she wasn’t sure I believed her.

She huffed, giving me a look of impatience. “Any other demands?”

My gaze lingered on hers, trying to read whatever was hidden beneath the surface.

My mouth opened, then shut again.

I exhaled, steadying myself. “Do you honestly want to share this world with me?” I asked, quiet but resolute.

Her face turned red. “Not answering that!” She composed herself. “You got your one guarantee. Take it or leave it.”

“I’ll take it, I guess,” I sighed, the words slow and deliberate, a faint smirk tugging at my lips before I could stop it.

She quickly hid behind a sly grin, yet beneath the veneer of confidence, her gaze lingered on me with an unexpected softness. “Well then,” she said, her tone firm, commanding, and laced with possessiveness, “welcome to your new life with me.”

At that moment, I couldn’t have known what I was in for. But through the eternity of time, I can say I never once regretted asking her to stay. And though I pretend otherwise, the truth remains: it was she who gave this endless void its meaning.
