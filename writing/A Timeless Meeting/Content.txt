She leapt into the air, her voice sharp and unwavering. “Another step forward,” she warned, her long, wavy strawberry-colored hair floating as if held by her very presence, “and you die.” As she landed, she let out a giggle. Despite her small stature, and a voice that seemed too light for an immortal, there was no mistaking the threat. I knew that if I so much as turned my head, it would surely be severed from my body.
	
	Her piercing purple eyes locked onto mine, daring me to defy her. The oversized black lab coat she wore nearly swallowed her whole, its stark darkness making her pale skin almost luminescent. A mischievous grin spread across her face, as if she relished her undeniable authority.
"How... did... you... get... here?" she asked, dragging out each word, tilting her head dramatically with every syllable. An orange lollipop materialized out of thin air and, as if it had a mind of its own, floated effortlessly into her mouth.
Her patience quickly unraveled. "ANSWER!" she snapped, her voice slicing through the emptiness with commanding sharpness. Then, as though flipping a switch, her tone softened into a pitiful whimper. "Answer," she repeated, her bottom lip trembling in mock sorrow. The glint in her eyes, however, betrayed her feigned fragility.
Sensing the rapid shifts in her mood and the looming threat of another outburst, I stammered, “I, uh… had a few dreams. Dreams that might’ve included you. And then I just… somehow ended up here?”
She narrowed her gaze, tilting her head as if trying to decipher my answer. For a fleeting moment, her expression shifted, her dangerous demeanor fading. Her violet eyes seemed to look through me, as though I were an illusion. That’s when I took in our surroundings.
This place was unlike anything else, both familiar and alien. It was the same void I’d seen in my dreams: an infinite expanse of nothingness. No stars, no planets, no celestial bodies of any kind. Just an empty, perfect void. I had half-expected her to adorn it with grand icy castles or swirling wormholes, but she’d left it untouched - just as I had always imagined. Perhaps she shared my unspoken understanding of this place. I only hoped she didn’t feel the same way about me.
“Nope,” she finally said, her voice cutting through my thoughts.
She crossed her arms and floated upside down, her hair flowing freely in defiance of gravity. “You simply do not exist,” she declared, her voice fading into a whisper as she vanished.
“I exist!” I insisted, as though trying to convince her. “What? Where did you go?”
My legs ached from standing so long, but before I could shift my weight, she reappeared, suddenly inches from my face. Her expression gleamed with glee, as though she anticipated something unspeakably entertaining.
“Okay,” she smirked, “let's test that theory.”
 In a blur of motion, her fist drove into my stomach with an impact that felt like it could shatter stars. I was hurled miles from the point of contact, tumbling through the air. Yet, before I could even process the pain, it vanished entirely, as if wiped away by her will.
When I finally staggered back, she was sprawled on the ground, laughing uncontrollably. Was it really that funny?
I sighed, cutting through her amusement. “How did you vanish? I thought this was the only place you could exist?”
She pouted, folding her arms. “Oh, so now you know everything, huh?”
“I don’t even know how I got here,” I shot back.
Her grin returned, sly and condescending. “Does your poor little brain need answers?” she cooed, her tone dripping with mockery, like a parent teasing a toddler.
Before I could respond, she straightened up. “Fine! Since you’re practically begging on your hands and knees for the truth you so desperately crave, I’ll indulge you.”
She paused dramatically, then listed her answers as if they were simple multiplication tables. “I never left, I was just invisible. Duh. And you got here the same way I did. I, too, dreamed of this place.”
“Maybe a thank you?” she pressed, clearly enjoying herself.
“Then?” I said plainly.
She continued, “Well it was only natural that after dreaming of this place I-” She paused, her gaze dropping to her feet, where the delicate fabric of her stockings shimmered faintly in the light. “Oh… I don’t actually know,” she admitted, her voice faltering with a rare hint of embarrassment.
She floated higher, speaking to herself more than me. “I suppose I’ll have to leave now that this world has a new occupant…”
The silence stretched as her words settled around me, the lingering melancholy tugging at something deep inside me. It struck me that she must have grown accustomed to solitude. She seemed untouchable. In my dreams, she radiated through the void exactly the same. For someone such as me to suggest accompanying her would be nonsense. The despondency bounced between us, dragging us down together.
“Do you have the ability to read minds?” I muttered.
“Nope,” she groaned. “Do you?”
“If only,” I sighed, the longing evident in my tone.
The words hung in the air as a thought settled in my mind: many people spend their lives chasing dreams they never reach. But here I was, with mine right in front of me, waiting. Letting this dream slip away would be an insult to them. But, more than that, it would be an insult to me.
"Why can’t we just share this world?" I suggested, my voice a little bolder than I felt.
Her eyes widened, a faint blush dusting her cheeks. She quickly hid behind a sly grin, yet beneath the veneer of confidence, her gaze lingered on me, carrying an unexpected softness. “Well then,” she said, her tone firm, commanding, and laced with possessiveness, “welcome to your new life with me.”
Though countless eternities have passed, our first encounter remains as surreal as ever.
